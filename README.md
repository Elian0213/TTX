**Not real money**, **not crypto-related**, and **never** will be.

Perform up to the minute statistical pricing analysis to time your purchases and sales to maximize your investment potential (all tax free, as we are free from pesky regulations).

**Our algorithm is a proprietary technology and thus is not opensource to avoid any unfair manipulation. To ensure fairness, it is audited thoroughly by our independent partner [Clancy Research](https://github.com/Clancy-Research/about/blob/main/README.md).**
