## Invest in your favorite Creators

## How it Works

TTX is a fantasy stock market for Twitch streamers. You can buy and sell shares of your favorite creators. Not real money, not crypto-related, and never will be.

Perform up to the minute statistical pricing analysis to time your purchases and sales to maximize your investment potential (all tax free, as we are free from pesky regulations).

Oh.. how does the pricing work? You don't know how the NYSE works, ya know... so just pump and dump! I mean... buy low, sell high... I mean dollar cost average! Be responsible, have fun, don't call the SEC. TTX, be truly invested in your streamer.
